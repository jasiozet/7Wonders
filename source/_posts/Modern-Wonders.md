When you combine it with other replacement effect like:
* Marketplace (Base game)
* West Trading (Base Game)
* East Trading (Base game)
* West Emporium (Armada)
* East Emporium (Armada) the effect don't multiply the price is still 1.

When you combine it with a discount effect like:
* Clandestine Dock East/West (Cities) 
* Smugglers' Cache (Cities 2nd edition/Cities Anniversary Pack) 
they do stack and you can "buy" resources for 0🪙 in certain circumstances (when those cards provide the discount)
